# Customer Churn Prediction
## Purpose of Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which is when customers stop doing business with a company. Customer churn occurs in various industries, including telecommunications, software, retail, banking, and more. It is essential for companies to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain customers, as acquiring new customers is typically more costly than retaining existing ones. This project aims to build a model that predicts customer churn by testing different classification methods and selecting the best-performing model.
What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, ceasing to use its products or services. Several factors contribute to customer churn:

* Dissatisfaction: Customers may be unhappy with the company's offerings and seek alternatives.
* Better offers: Competitors may provide better deals, such as lower prices or enhanced features, enticing customers to switch.
* Lack of interest: If customers do not find value or engagement with a company's offerings, they are more likely to churn.
* Changing needs: Customers' preferences and requirements evolve over time. If a company fails to adapt, customers may find more suitable alternatives.
* Bad experience: Negative experiences, such as poor customer service or unresolved issues, can drive customers away.
* Life events: Events like relocation, financial difficulties, or a company shutting down may lead customers to discontinue their relationship with a company.

To mitigate customer churn, companies analyze its occurrence, understand its underlying causes, and devise strategies to minimize it. Some strategies include improving customer service, enhancing product or service offerings, offering rewards for customer loyalty, gathering customer satisfaction feedback, and proactively engaging with customers showing signs of potential churn.
Finding the Best Model

To predict customer churn accurately, we explore various classification methods using Python libraries. These libraries help with data preparation, model training and evaluation. We employ techniques like StandardScaler for feature scaling, train_test_split for data splitting, and different classifiers such as KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GaussianNB, SVC, and LogisticRegression. Furthermore, we employ evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
Data Loading

The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle that contains information about telecom customers and their churn status. We load the dataset using the pandas library's read_csv function, which enables us to read and manipulate the dataset within our program.
Cleaning and Transforming Dataset

We perform necessary cleaning and transformation on the dataset to ensure its suitability for model training. The cleaned dataset, telecom_customer_churn.csv, comprises telecom customer information and their corresponding churn status.
## Data Preprocessing

Before training our model, we preprocess the dataset by splitting it into two parts: one for features (information aiding churn prediction) and another for the target variable (the churn status itself). We use the train_test_split function to create separate training and testing datasets. The training dataset educates our model, while the testing dataset evaluates its predictive capability.

To ensure feature comparability and enhance the performance of models relying on distances between data points, we employ the StandardScaler program. It scales the features to similar ranges.
Model Selection and Evaluation

In this phase, we explore different models to determine the most effective one for predicting churn. We employ techniques like k-fold cross-validation, which involves splitting the data into several parts. Each part serves as both training and testing data for evaluating the model's performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score are computed for each model.

We store the cross-validation results, including accuracy, precision, and F1 score, in separate lists and organize them in a DataFrame. Sorting the DataFrame by accuracy allows us to identify the best-performing model.
# Building our Model
## What is Random Forest Classifier?

The selected best-performing model for churn prediction in this project is the random forest classifier. To understand this model, consider the following analogy: when faced with a significant decision, like choosing a vacation destination, seeking advice from multiple individuals with diverse experiences and opinions is valuable. Each person offers a suggestion based on their knowledge, and a final decision is made through voting. This approach leverages input from multiple sources, increasing reliability and accuracy.

In machine learning, the random forest classifier operates similarly. It comprises a group of decision trees, with each tree making predictions based on different parts of the data. The random forest combines these predictions to generate the final prediction. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data, created by randomly selecting examples. Additionally, each tree considers only a random subset of features when making decisions. This randomness and diversity among trees help prevent overfitting and produce more reliable predictions.

Training a random forest classifier involves the following steps:

* Random Sampling: Randomly selecting subsets of the training data (with replacement) to create multiple bootstrap samples. Each sample trains an individual decision tree.
* Feature Subset Selection: Considering only a random subset of features at each split of a decision tree. This process introduces randomness and diversity among the trees.
* Building Decision Trees: Training decision trees on each bootstrap sample using a specific criterion (e.g., Gini impurity or information gain) to recursively split the data based on selected features.
* Voting for Prediction: Making predictions individually with each decision tree. In classification tasks, the predicted class from each tree is considered, and the class with the majority of votes becomes the final prediction.

Random forests offer several advantages, including:

* Robustness: Random forests are less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees. Aggregating multiple trees reduces variance and improves prediction accuracy.
* Feature Importance: Random forests provide a measure of feature importance based on their contribution to overall model performance. This information aids feature selection and enhances understanding of the underlying data.
* Handling High-Dimensional Data: Random forests effectively handle datasets with a large number of features by randomly selecting feature subsets at each split.
* Parallelization: The training and prediction processes of random forests can be easily parallelized, facilitating efficient computation on modern hardware.

## Model Training and Evaluation

After trying various models, we determine that the random forest classifier performs the best for predicting customer churn. We train the model using the training data and evaluate its performance on both the training and testing datasets. Accuracy scores are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness.
Hyper-parameter Tuning

To optimize the performance of the random forest classifier, we adjust hyper-parameters, which are settings affecting the model's behavior. We utilize grid search (GridSearchCV) to explore different combinations of hyper-parameters and evaluate their performance through cross-validation. The mean accuracy scores guide the selection of the best parameter combination.

The best hyper-parameters found during the tuning process are printed, along with the corresponding scores for each parameter combination.
Model Training with Tuned Hyper-parameters

Once the best settings for the random forest classifier are identified, a new model called "good_model" is created using those settings. The model is trained using the training data, and predictions are made for the testing data. Accuracy, precision, recall, and a classification report are computed to evaluate the model's performance.
